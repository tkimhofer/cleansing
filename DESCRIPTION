Description: Data cleaning is time consuming and in most cases, isn't fun at all! This package contains functions to semi-automate variable cleaning (e.g., data type conversions, NA removal, stratification of multi-level variables), as well as to generate summary statistics that give an overview of variables, missing values, etc.
